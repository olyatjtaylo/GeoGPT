Some geographic transformations (for example, NTv2, GEOCON, and NADCON5) and vertical transformations based on geoids, quasi-geoids, or other conversion grids (for example, EGM and VERTCON) require additional data files.
 
This download arranges these data files into a different file structure to that used in previous releases. This change has been made in order to accommodate requirements for all Esri's products and future functionality developments, given the increasing number of files and file sizes.

This new file structure is suitable for apps built with ArcGIS Maps SDK version 200.1 or later.

ArcGIS Maps SDK version 200.0.0 and previous versions are not compatible with the file structure in this download. To share projection engine data between apps built with ArcGIS Maps SDK versions 200.0.0 or earlier, and version 200.1.0 or later, use a download of projection engine data files for version 200.1.0 or earlier.
