21. geographic\europe\slovenia\ntv2\SI_D48_D96_GRID.gsb:
    The binary grid shift file approximates a transformation between D48 and D96 geodetic datums in
    Slovenia. The official transformation uses a triangle-based method using virtual tie points and
    converts between D48/GK and D96/TM coordinate reference coordinate systems.The shift file was developed
    by Esri using results from the free 3tra software provided by the Surveying and Mapping Authority
    of the Republic of Slovenia. Transformations using the shift file may produce up to 1 cm differences
    from the results given by the 3tra software. Transformations using the shift file should not be used
    for official cadastral work or for any other workflows requiring high accuracy and precision. When
    using the shift file, review the output data to verify its accuracy and consistency.
